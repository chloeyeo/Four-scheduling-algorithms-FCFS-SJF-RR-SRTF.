# Four-scheduling-algorithms-FCFS-SJF-RR-SRTF.
Uses and extends a simple discrete event simulator written in Python, by creating classes that simulate the scheduling and dispatching of processes performed by four scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Round-Robin (RR) and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF).
